### Problem we are trying to solve

We all have been in the situation where we need to transfer some files from an untrusted device. We are forced to log-in in our personal accounts to either email to ourself or upload it to a drive/cloud.

### How does it do it?

The above solutions have many security holes because the device is untrusted. Well Flink to the rescue! simply upload files and get a personal token. Use this token to download the uploaded file from any device!
